https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1326235947747463171\n-->\n<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>10:28pm</b> Rohit Sharma receives the trophy from Sourav Ganguly and Mumbai Indians are officially champions of IPL 2020. A title well defended, in what's been a strange year for the world. Was quite an effort to have this tournament begin during what had been an extended meltdown globally, and we've come pretty far. We'll sign off the way we began - grateful to those who fought on the frontlines, and continue to do so. A thought also for Dean Jones, who couldn't be part of this closing night. We hope you enjoyed our coverage and, rest assured, we will catch you soon during all the cricket that's coming up. On behalf of Chandan, Raghav, Sid Monga, and the rest of our team (who will bring you plenty of analysis any time now), this is Varun Shetty saying goodbye.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Rohit Sharma:</b> Pretty happy with how things went the entire season for us. We said at the start we want to make winning a habit, and you couldn't have asked any more from the guys. We were right on the money from ball one and even until today, we never looked back. A lot of credit goes to people behind the scenes as well. We gotta give a lot of credit. Our work starts much earlier than the IPL starts. We analyse what went wrong, what needs to improved, stuff like that. You've got to find the right balance where you need to stay calm [as a leader]. I'm not someone who'll run with a stick behind someone. The only way you can do it is by giving them confidence. If you look at our batting, between Hardik, Krunal and Polly, we've been rotating them. In the bowling dept. too we try what works with us - Chahar was unfortunate, we needed Jayant tactically. When you want to change your XI to make it better, you should be able to do that [without letting someone down hard]. Ishan Kishan is someone who you can't cloud his judgement, he has to do what he wants to do in the field. Surya, the kind of form he was in, I should have sacrificed my wicket. I give him a lot of credit, it's not easy to do that. Some of the season he played incredible shots. These two guys, you got to keep motivating them and giving confidence and they come out with performances like that. We try and engage with out fans, unfortunately they could't be here, but their support means a lot. Fans are who  make the game special for us. Missed playing in Wankhede.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mahela Jayawardene, Mumbai coach:</b> I wish I could explain myself. I don't think it was easy. You have the tag of being champions and Mumbai not winning the even years - so I had to bring the boys together. What we've done is try and be consistent with the processes and preparation, trying to get the guys used to that. Not try to do anything more or less. Obviously this year has been a little different. But the guys enjoyed that setup. I think the six-hitting has been in Mumbai's DNA for a while. What we try is to play to a tempo, the touch play. Credit to the franchise who allow us to do this, make a bit of history. It's all about helping them prepare and make sure they understand the roles they play, making things easy for them. We've got a leadership group out there so we try and give them a bit of work to do. The boys have heard my other side [the one that's no soft-spoken], once in a while. They showed what they can do out there.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Shreyas Iyer:</b> I've mentioned it heaps of times, Ricky is probably the best I've worked with. The amount of freedom he gives is amazing. I love being beside him. He's a confident coach, I really respect him a lot. The way he's been conducting meetings and motivating guys has been great. IPL always amazes you. Probably one of the toughest leagues to play. I feel overwhelmed playing in such a league. It's been a great journey. I'm very proud of my boys, it's not a small feat to reach the final. It was a great achievement. Winning the IPL is something more - one step ahead. We'll come back stronger and see to it that we win the trophy. I would just like to tell the fans that you've been great support through the season.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ricky Ponting, DC coach:</b> You've gotta give credit where credit's due. MI have clearly been the better team, they beat us four times. I'm extremely proud at how we played our cricket. We have a great set of players. It's been great fun. Iyer is a brilliant young player, a brilliant captain and even more so a great person. He's grown in stature in the last 12 months. I love every moment and hopefully we can forget together a bit more in the future. Probably had too much preparation to be honest. We had 3-4 weeks before our first game. We played some brilliant stuff, fell off a little. It's a tournament that's been extremely well run. I was skeptical whether the tournament would go through.<br/><bR>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Jofra Archer is the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.</b><br/><bR>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mumbai Indians win the Fairplay award.</b><br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Padikkal:</b> Thank you so much, it gives me great confidence. Hopefully I can take it ahead and do well in the future tournaments.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Devdutt Padikkal is the Emerging Player of the year.</b><br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Trent Boult:</b> Like the powerplay some days, yeah! It's been a good couple of months. I've thoroughly enjoyed being with the franchise. We've had a good couple of months and to get across the line is all worth it. Little bit of a niggle coming in, but of course I wanted to be on the stage doing my thing. Sometimes there are nerves but I'd like to say I'm relatively experienced, it's just another match.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Trent Boult is the Man of the Match.</b><br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<!--\nname: twitter\nurl: https://twitter.com/ParthJindal11/status/1326220247712604162\n-->\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>K Pollard:</b> It's a great feeling. I've been here 11 years, fifth trophy. No one sees the planning and training, it's pressure playing for a franchise like this. The amount of trophies, the amount of work, the amount of players who go on to play for their countries, I think we'll have to say so [that this is the best T20 franchise]. Kudos to the owners and management. Long may that continue. Dwayne Bravo you're behind now and I'm in front of you, just had to say it on camera.<<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Robin Singh (Mumbai batting coach):</b> It's always nice to be bheind the scenes to try and conttibute to someone's success. Ishan has taken a lot of responsibulity, alongside guys like Polly. We do celebrate, it's just that I don't show it in front. [Pollard confirms Robin keeps it subtle, after Hardik says off screen that Robin is always in the gym at 6am no matter what].\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>R Chahar:</b> Feeling good winning back to back. Playing [in the XI] wasn't as important as winning this title. I think my strengths are that I can turn the ball, bowl slowly, push them through - all my variations. [On his haircut] Takes at least half an hour before the match.<bR><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Jayant Yadav:</b> Happy to win the title. It's a great feeling to be champions two years in a row. Ithink it's the effort you put in throughout the season. It's a long tournament and you have to be professional in your preparation. This was a tactical move and [had to be read]. It's part of being a professional. You'll always be in the battle for small battles designed for you.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Quinton de Kock:</b> Mumbai have a great set up, so we've been able to move with the gym work and training and stuff. We're reaping the rewards today for it. It's a great feeling. I think this year because there were so many questions around Mumbai in general, whether we can win back to back, we put in extra effort. You can see it's paid off. We worked extra hard on the nitty gritties.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<B>Nathan Coulter-Nile:</b> Patto was bowloing beautifully, so I was happy to sit on the sidelines and wait for my turn. He would have done just as well a job today. Just glad for the opportunity.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ishan Kishan:</b> I think to be honest, I was not looking in good shape before this season. I spoke Krunal and Haridk and worked on my fitness and my off-side play.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Krunal Pandya:</b> It's the hunger. The way we went about the games, there was always 100%. A lot of credit goes to how we prepared. One month before we came, everyone knew their roles. Everyone was in good shape, just executing what they were doing in the nets. [On Ishan] There have never been doubts about his talent. The No. 1 thing I liked about him was that he was ready to listen and improve. All credit to him, the way he came back. The first game he was not there and then coming back in, batting at 4 and then opening, the way he's taken this opportunity,really happy for him and hope he continues doing this.<br/><bR>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Hardik Pandya:</b> [Not being able to bowl] didn't bother me. I enjoy what I do. For me it's about the opportunity. It's all about preparation. On that we did well and focused on improving day by day.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Suryakumar Yadav:</b> Preparations, processes and routine is important. the team just said one thing - we'll take care of this. You go and express yourself. [The Rohit sacrifice] he was batting really well. Most importantly, he's been anchoring well since the first game. I don't mind sacrificing for him at all.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Jasprit Bumrah:</b> It means a great deal to play. We know it's a difficult time, everyone is stuck at home. We're lucky that we could come to work and entertain people watching at home. If we could bring smiles to their faces, it's the best thing we could do. From the first game I felt my rhythm was up. The last piece of the puzzle was missing. But when I bowled the Super Over, I had to execute against Virat and AB and since then it clicked into place.<br/><bR>\n</p>\n<p>\n<!--\nname: twitter\nurl: https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1326214481785966592\n-->\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>9:20pm</b> That is a 4-0 drubbing of Delhi Capitals for Mumbai Indians, as if to reinforce how much better they have been than the second-placed team of the tournament. There was no beating them this season. <b>Title number 5.</b> Odd year, even year, leap year, pandemic year - doesn't matter. This is the best team performance ever in an IPL season. Period. What a team. Everyone has come to the fore at some point or the other. And some more often than others. It was Trent Boult again, leading the rout after Mumbai lost the toss. And with the bat, Rohit Sharma led the charge. A nice touch that Ishan Kishan was also there at the end. What a tournament he has had too. Handshakes and pats on the back for Mumbai's two batsmen out there - even Delhi Capitals know they've been completely, utterly outplayed by a side worthy of this championship. For them, it's another successful season. At the very least, it's a step forward. They fell short of their first final last year, but they managed to get past the playoffs this time. Only to run into Mumbai, against whom they just didn't have answers at any point in the season. It was a season of superb highs in the first half, a massive battle through the middle as injuries made them lopsided, and then a huff and puff at the end, doing just enough to stay alive a little longer and bank on the early success. They will be a better side with a few tweaks - it's a project the owners can be very proud of.<br/><br/>The larger picture - another IPL season comes to a close. Heaven knows it was a difficult proposition to even pull the tournament off, let alone one of this quality. Closely fought till the end, top quality pitches throughout, and most importantly - one completed with almost 100% safety. A top effort.\n</p>","speed_kph":"","speed_mph":"","text":"yorker just outside off, jabs it into the covers, runs to the other end with his arms aloft.
